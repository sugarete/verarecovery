# <p align="center">VeraCrypt Password Recovery on FPGA</p>

<p align="justify">
The primary idea of password recovery is actually cracking it. So basically, the main concept of this repository will be to brute-force the virtual disk's password. This repository contains the following modules:
</p>

<div align="justify">
<ul>
    <li>Password Generator: Generate passwords using Brute-force attack and Dictionary attack.</li>
    <li>KDF (PBKDF2 - HMAC - WHIRLPOOL): Derive a strong key for the decryption process from the password generated by the Password Generator.</li>
    <li>Decrypt (SERPENT - XTS): Our verification step. It takes the disk's encrypted data and a key, tries to bring the plain data back. It then compares the plain data with some constraints. If they match, then the key is correct.</li>
</ul>
